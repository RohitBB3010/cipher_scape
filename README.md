# Cryptography Puzzle Escape Game
I originally started this game project as part of a Cryptography class, but it quickly became a personal passion project. The game combines cryptography with an engaging storyline, creating a challenging and immersive experience.

## Game Overview
In this game, the player takes on the role of a scientist trapped in an abandoned library after being poisoned by a group of evil scientists. The only way to escape is by solving cryptographic puzzles using classic techniques such as the Playfair, Vigenère, and Caesar ciphers. The game is designed across three levels, with each one becoming progressively harder as the player advances.

## Key Features
**Story-driven gameplay**: The player must race against time, solving puzzles to escape before it's too late.  
**Three levels of increasing difficulty**: Each level introduces more complex challenges.  
**Progress saving**: Player progress is saved after clearing a level, but losing at any point means starting over from the beginning.  
**Variety of puzzles**: The game offers different cryptographic puzzles on each attempt, so no two playthroughs are the same.  
**Immersive visuals**: The game features carefully designed images to enhance the storytelling and puzzle-solving experience.

## How to Play
1. Solve the puzzles on each level to advance.
2. Each puzzle utilizes a different cryptographic technique (Playfair, Vigenère, Caesar).
3. Progress is saved after each level, but losing means restarting from level one.
4. Every playthrough offers a fresh set of puzzles, adding replay value.
